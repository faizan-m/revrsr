This is a sample Unity3D Project displaying video from an Mjpg stream.

To use:

1. Open "Mjpg Viewer/Assets/Scenes/Sample Mjpeg Viewer.unity" in Unity3D.

2. Select the plane acting as the video screen and edit the url parameter to display a live MJPEG stream (you can use these to test with https://febon.blogspot.com/2013/02/public-free-ip-address-for-motion-jpeg.html ). The url should end in .mjpg

3. Play the Sample Mjpeg Viewer scene and wait a few seconds for the MJPEG stream to connect.

Enjoy!
