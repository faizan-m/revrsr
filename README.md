COMP50: Autonomous Intelligent Robotics
Tufts University

This project was developed to allow a user to experience the world from a remote robot's perspective using Virtual Reality. We were able to develop a two-way communication between VR and Oculus set up using Unity and ROS-Sharp and stream the the robot's camera and depth images through ROS web-video-server.

This project served as a learning ground for Faizan and Amel's summer project, [Augmented Reality Framework in Unity for ROS
](https://github.com/faizan-m/arfuros). NOTE: Currently a private repository as it is under development and being used for studies.
